summary: "This paper proposes a matching model of the labor market with job rationing: unemployment does not disappear in the absence of matching frictions. In recessions, job rationing drives the rise in unemployment, whereas matching frictions contribute little to unemployment."

##### Abstract

Emotion recognition has opened up many challenges, which lead to various advances in computer vision and artificial intelligence. The rapid development in this field has encouraged the development of an automatic system that could accurately analyze and measure the emotions of human beings via facial expressions. This study mainly focuses on facial expression recognition from visual cues, as visual information is the most prominent channel for social communication. The paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in algorithm development, presents the overall findings performed over the past decades, discusses their advantages and constraints. It explores the transition from the laboratory-controlled environment to challenging real-world (in-the-wild) conditions, focusing on essential issues that require further exploration. Finally, relevant opportunities in this field, challenges, and future directions mentioned in this paper assist the researchers and academicians in designing efficient and robust facial expression recognition systems.
